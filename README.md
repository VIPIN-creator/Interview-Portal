# Interview-Portal
This is a Interview-Portal used to schedule interviews.
We can add Candidates with their emails. 
The interview time is validated by checking the start time and end time.
Then from a list of all the candidates that are available at the given slot time , at least 2 candidates are chosen.
If in a given slot time less than 2 candidates are available then interview can't be scheduled.
After interview is succesfully scheduled all the candidates get mail notifications.
Each Candidate is uniquely identified by its mailid.
Each interview is uniquely identified by the job for which it is conducted.
